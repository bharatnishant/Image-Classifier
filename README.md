# Cat vs Dog Classifier using PyTorch

The repository contains a classifier created using PyTorch. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained using ImageNet dataset: resnet50. The classifier for the network is re-written to suit it for classificatin task of Cats and Dogs, which is a multi-layered perceptron network, embedded with CNN with an accuracy score of 98%.
