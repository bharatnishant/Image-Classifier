# Cat vs Dog Classifier using PyTorch

The repository contains a classifier created using PyTorch. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network pre-trained using ImageNet dataset: resnet50. The classifier for the network is re-written to suit it for classificatin task of Cats and Dogs, which is a multi-layered perceptron network, embedded with CNN. The model has attained accuracy til, around 95% on the data, more could be achieved tuning some hyper-parameters.
